## Reporting Security Issues

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is dedicated to the responsible investigation of security vulnerabilities.  
  
We kindly ask that you **do not** open a public GitHub issue to report security concerns.  
  
Instead, please use one of the following options:  

- Submit the issue to the AWS Vulnerability Disclosure Program via [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/aws_vdp)  
- Send your report via [email](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com)  
  
For more details, visit the [AWS Vulnerability Reporting Page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).  

Thank you for working with us to protect our customers!
